# Pertimm Maze Solver

This project is a Node.js program that solves the Pertimm maze game automatically by interacting with the game API.

---

## Features

- Starts a new game with a player name.
- Explores the maze using API calls.
- Uses backtracking algorithm to find the exit.
- Prints the maze state in the console with emojis for visualization.
- Handles traps and dead ends.
- Clean and modular code with separation in constants, API calls, map utilities, solver logic, and main entry point.
